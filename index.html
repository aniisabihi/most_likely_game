        <p>Two players stand with their backs to each other. A question will be asked to the player pair by another player.
            The player pair answers the question by pointing at themselves, or away from themselves. Both point to
            themselves or away from themselves, the players get to drink. If the players point to the same person,
            everyone else drink.

        <p>TLDR:</p>
        <p>If the player pair agree with each other, everyone else gets to drink!
            If the player pair do NOT agree with each other, the player pair drink!</p>
